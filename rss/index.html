<p>While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times, and now said: "The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one." "How do you know?" "Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund." "But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance," observed Sir Francis. "That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium." "But where are they taking her?" "To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night there." "And the sacrifice will take place&mdash;" "To-morrow, at the first light of dawn."</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/on-a-marvelous-journey/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">2b49271c-bf89-4756-81e0-6ae2e60927c8</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 11:11:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[To the Center of the earth]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/tumblr_n89lhpz1Zi1qz5ao4o1_1280.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my expression than in my words, for presently he laid his hand upon my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Man of another world," he said, "I believe you.  Lips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes it tells only the truth.  Your heart has spoken to me.  I know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.  She is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister. She does not know it&mdash;her mother was stolen by Dian's father who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz to battle with us for our women&mdash;the most beautiful women of Pellucidar.  Then was her father king of Amoz, and her mother was daughter of the king of Sari&mdash;to whose power I, his son, have succeeded.  Dian is the daughter of kings, though her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed him and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.  Because of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly magnified in the eyes of all who saw it.  She will never forgive you."</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/down-to-the-center-of-the-earth/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">7b8f1d53-965b-49a6-97c9-86e21ca54d36</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 10:48:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Whale Ho!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/tumblr_n8yspvxPzN1rraqsio1_1280.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,&mdash;So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south&mdash;wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don't be too particular.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/whale-ho/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">246f24a5-3cb7-4069-93e7-31b0f4fb6c15</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2014 10:32:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[War in Our World]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/tumblr_n8u03fjMXG1tsehdeo1_1280.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this mysterious death--as swift as the passage of light--would leap after me from the pit about the cylinder and strike me down. It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so swiftly and so silently.  Many think that in some way they are able to generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute non-conductivity.  This intense heat they project in a parallel beam against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse projects a beam of light.  But no one has absolutely proved these details.  However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the essence of the matter.  Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.  Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon water, incontinently that explodes into steam.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/war-in-our-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">92a011ca-b89d-426f-91ed-7e45acda45cf</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 21:54:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Off to the Wizard]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>"You're more than that," said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; "you're a humbug." "Exactly so!" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if it pleased him.  "I am a humbug." "But this is terrible," said the Tin Woodman.  "How shall I ever get my heart?" "Or I my courage?" asked the Lion. "Or I my brains?" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes with his coat sleeve. "My dear friends," said Oz, "I pray you not to speak of these little things.  Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found out." "Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?" asked Dorothy. "No one knows it but you four--and myself," replied Oz.  "I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found out.  It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room.  Usually I will not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible." "But, I don't understand," said Dorothy, in bewilderment.  "How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?" "That was one of my tricks," answered Oz.  "Step this way, please, and I will tell you all about it." He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all followed him. </p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/off-to-the-wizard/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">72359e64-3906-4735-886d-730bd006accf</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 21:40:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Down The Rabbit Hole]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/tumblr_n8rr14TMvx1qajmbto1_1280-1.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly. 'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in  a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,  "French, music, AND WASHING&mdash;extra."' 'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of  the sea.' 'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I  only took the regular course.' 'What was that?' inquired Alice. 'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle  replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic&mdash;Ambition,  Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.' 'I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?' The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of  uglifying!' it exclaimed.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/boom-boom/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">9e795d95-cc3f-4655-a891-bcbf2b7f177f</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 18:22:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Let's go around the world]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><img src='http://my-ghost-blog.com/content/images/2014/Jul/tumblr_n8vch5ikQB1qb5t88o1_1280.jpg'  alt="" /></p>

<p>"Do you know where he is, sir?" asked Aouda anxiously. "What!" responded Fix, feigning surprise.  "Is he not with you?" "No," said Aouda.  "He has not made his appearance since yesterday. Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?" "Without you, madam?" answered the detective.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/hello-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">9bb524fa-8a16-4ab3-a266-c55c1b5a94ec</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[silverlight513]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2014 18:22:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
